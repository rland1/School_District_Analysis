## Overview of the School District Analysis

Maria is redoing her analysis on school district analysis due to invalid ninth grade scores. We are assisting her to replace the scores for math and reading for Thomas High School for the invalid fields with NaNs and keep everything else the same. Then we will compare the analysis to the initial analysis to see how the results differ. 

## Results

- District Summary 
  - When looking at the top 15 schools, the average reading score increased by .1, the average math score stayed the same. The overall passing score dropped by 0.2%. 

- School Summary
  - Bailey highschool remains the top overall school. All other schools summaries also remained the same for summaries. 

- Thomas High School Summary 
  - The Thomas High School stats did not change after this analysis. 

  - Math and Reading scores by grade
    - Math and Reading scores by grade did not change between the two analyses either. 
  - Scores by School Spending
    - School spending was not affected by the updated analysis either. 
  - Scores by School Size
    - School size scores and percentages did not change after this analysis either. 
  - Scores by School Type 
    - It did not change the average math or reading scores. Additionally, removing the invalid scores from the ninth data did not change the overall passing percentages and math percentages, and reading percentages. So removing the data did not have a huge effect on the results, however is better to have more reliable data.
